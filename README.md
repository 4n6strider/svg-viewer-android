# Android SVG viewer

Uses native webview for rendering SVG.

Adds an intent filter so you can open SVG files from a file manager application
such as [CMFileManager](https://github.com/jruesga/CMFileManager).

This application uses the official [W3C SVG logo](http://www.w3.org/2009/08/svg-logos.html).

If you don't want to build it yourself, you can install this application via
the [Google Play
store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=biz.codefuture.svgviewer).
