Android SVG viewer.

Uses native webview for SVG rendering.

Adds an intent filter so you can open SVG files from a file manager application
such as [CMFileManager](https://github.com/jruesga/CMFileManager).

This application uses the official [W3C SVG logo](http://www.w3.org/2009/08/svg-logos.html).
